NgenWrapper is a managed wrapper for Ngen.exe (Native Image Generator) tool in .NET.

The wrapper is written in C# and provides better control over ngening progress in custom installers.

It captures all the output generated by the ngen.exe and provides simple interface to start, handle progress, or cancel ngening.
