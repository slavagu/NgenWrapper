# Introduction

NgenWrapper is a managed wrapper for Ngen.exe (Native Image Generator) tool in .NET.

The wrapper is written in C# and provides better control over ngening 
progress in custom installers. It captures all the output generated by 
the ngen.exe and provides simple interface to start, show progress, or 
cancel ngening. 

For Ngen documentation [see MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6t9t5wcf.aspx).

# Samples

Usage samples are available in the NgenWrapper.Tests project. 

	// install assembly with all dependencies
	Ngen.InstallAssembly("MyApplication.exe")

	// install assembly with all dependencies and live progress indication
    using (var ngenLauncher = new NgenLauncher())
    {
        ngenLauncher.Progress += (o, a) => Console.WriteLine("---> {0}/{1} {2} ", a.Current, a.Total, a.Assembly);
        ngenLauncher.InstallAssembly("MyApplication.exe");
        ngenLauncher.WaitForExit();
        return ngenLauncher.IsSuccessful;
    }
